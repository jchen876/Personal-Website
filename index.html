          I'm currently back in School. I was working on <a class="link" href="https://www.sail.exchange/" target="_blank">Sail</a>. I also do MEV research, focused on finding
            <a class ="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive_compatibility" target =_blank">incentive compatibile</a> solutions for MEV auctions.  
            I spend most of my time at my computer. I like racket sports, city planning, <s>astronomy</s>, concerts and sharing music.
            I try to avoid dogmatism and pessimism. I wish I cried more. I've reached the highest rank in every online game I've dedicated time to. 
            I wrote my first line of code in 2010 to cheat gold in AdventureQuest. 
            I like startups. I am in the process of learning meditation.
            I continue to code because I feel the most agency to contribute to others at scale.
