    <p>
      I'm currently doing MEV research and exploring the impacts of MEV on different blockchains. 
      I spend most of my time at my computer.
      I like racket sports, city planning, astronomy, music and concerts.
      I think nihilism is quite boring.
      I wish I cried more.
      I've reached the highest rank in every online game I've dedicated time to.
      I wrote my first line of code in 2010 to get gold in AdventureQuest.
      I continue to code because I feel the most agency to contribute to others at scale.
